Significant paragraphs are enumerated by a numeral preceding the paragraph on the same line, as in `0 Paragraph one.\\n\\n1 Paragraph two.` Essays sometimes refer to a paragraph by its numeral. Each article is preceded with its title in a heading, like `# Title`. When an author is indicated, their name will be given in the title after `by`. Not all articles have authors indicated. An article may have subheadings indicated like `## Subheading`.\n",
